                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size
                    of a
                    marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile,
                    so
                    delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

                <p>Moving into it, first let's list out our options: Jabs and Tilts. Rivals of Aether allows you to
                    automatically cancel Jab attacks
                    into Tilt attacks. However, you can not cancel Tilts into Jabs. Additionally, Jab attacks will not
                    put the user into Parry Stun even
                    if the opposer Parries your attack. This is often called Parry-Checking, or Jab-Checking. Looking at
                    Etalus' options specifically.
                    Let's get into some numbers, and options.
