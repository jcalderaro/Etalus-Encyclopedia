                    <h3>Matchup Guide:</h3>
                    <h3>Etalus VS Absa</h3>
                    </br>
                    <p><span>Written By NCB 06/23/2018</span></p>
                    <p><span>The Difficulty</span> in this matchup stems from the long range harassment, limited
                        recoveries, and insane fair-chains that Absa brings.
                        Luckily, mentors from the Rivals of Aether Academy worked together to write this guide.</p>
                    <p><span>In General</span>, despite the overwhelming long range poke, deadly aerials, and movement,
                        Etalus is not at a complete loss. Through
                        the use of rapid movement, disjoint moves and smart icicle usage - we can apply aerial pressure
                        to keep Absa right where we
                        want her.</p>
                    <p><span>For Movement</span>, Etalus is forced to take the role of aggressor in this matchup.
                        Through good platform movement
                        we can mitigate some of the cloud and ftilt options from Absa. Although, it's good to learn how
                        to reliably parry cloud, ftilt,
                        thunder line, and the timed explosion. Learning the timing windows and switching up movement
                        through plats allows us to close the gap.
                        It's important to note, avoid using DA or Wd for grounded movement, instead electing for running
                        as this lets use crouch to CC her Ftilt2
                        immediately. Be mindful when dropping down from plats as, even though Fair and Nair are
                        effective, we want to avoid Absa's nasty Utilt.</p>
                    <p><span>For Stage Selection</span>, while they don't have a giant impact on the matchup performance
                        - because Icicles are critical
                        to lock down Absa in the air, choosing small maps makes the challenge greater. Prioritize
                        larger, more open stages to deal with Absa.
                        Such as Merchant Port or The Fire Capital. Rock Wall is a trade off: while the open stage means
                        good icicle use, the close blast zones
                        means that Absa can carry you off stage with fair strings. We're not partial to ToH or Glacial
                        Fortress because of the close platforms.
                        Endless Abyss is also very risky: there are no platforms for Absa to hide from the icicles,
                        there is nothing to assist you in dodging Ftilts,
                        or clouds. Tempest Peak is alright, however sometimes the side platforms can hurt your
                        edgeguarding if Absa recovers low.</p>
                    <p><span>For Recovery</span>, saving your airdodge and double jump, try to recover using other
                        means. Be mindful that
                        when recovering high with Uspecial, Absa can chase you with Uair and kill you off top. Where as,
                        if you try to recover low
                        or near the stage, she can plant a cloud and contest the edge. Look to immediately wall tech
                        this. When recovering high,
                        throwing out Icicles can support you coming down. Or alternatively, the use of Fair armor.</p>
                    <p><span>For Edgeguarding</span>, the Absa's that like to recover with Uspecial movement, Etalus can
                        beat her out with proper spacing
                        on his disjoints. Alternatively, you can crouch cancel her Uspecial and then react with an
                        immediate punish.
                        For Absa's that recover low, using icicle with uspecial spike can handle her. Alternatively, if
                        she uses quick clouds to recover
                        then look for the opportunity to parry or fair armor through. As always, look for icicle to uair
                        confirms, or dtilt at edge.</p>
                    <p><span>Special Thanks</span>, I'd like to thank Bullets for help with the Edgeguarding section,
                        and to
                        all of the RoA Academy staff for the great help. With their shared knowledge, victory is in the
                        bag!</p>
                    <p><span>Quick Notes TLDR</span>, platform movement to deal with Ftilts and grounded clouds.
                        Wavedash less, run-to-crouch more.
                        Fair armor and Disjoint are very helpful when approaching. Save resources when recovering.
                        Icicles are essential to
                        apply aerial pressure. Stage selection favors Fire Capital and Merchant Port. Finally, be wary
                        when approaching Absa from above.</p>

                    <h3>Etalus VS Ranno</h3>
                    </br>
                    <p><span>Written By NCB 04/09/2018</span></p>
                    <p><span>The Difficulty</span> in this matchup stems from the multiple large hitboxes that can kill
                        early, as well as good
                        anti-approach options with needles and bair. Even with a tricky recovery and dreaded tongue,
                        there are still ways to slap
                        this meddlesome toad.</p>
                    <p><span>In General</span>, many people have different views of this MU, I’d put it at a solid
                        55/45, Ranno favored. Ranno has all the tools to snuff you out and make your recovery a
                        nightmare, but using good movement and move options, Etalus can still get around this frog and
                        slide into the victory screen. While Ranno does have many options that can be a nightmare to
                        deal with, you’ll soon learn that Etalus also has a few tricks up his sleeve to even out the
                        fight. With a bit of knowledge and practice, Etalus has everything needed to deal with Ranno,
                        given you know when to use your tools.</p>
                    <p><span>For Movement</span>, like in the Kragg MU, is the most important part of this Matchup.
                        Since Ranno has needle, nair, tongue, and plat drop bair, it’s usually not a good idea to rush
                        him from the ground unless you plan on spacing him out with some disjoint or armoring through
                        with fair. Do remember though that wavedash baits are very good against ranno if you can get him
                        to whiff a nair or bair. Since ranno is a fast character and requires a lot of quick reaction,
                        it may be better to wavedash less and run more against ranno. The reason for this is because
                        characters cannot begin a parry while in the wave land animation, whereas you can parry
                        immediately while running. While Ranno does have a lot of power near the ground and to his
                        sides, he is left with a few very big weak spots, especially above and diagonal below him. Use
                        this to your advantage to outangle him during his approaches, using platforms to approach from
                        above where he can’t contest you so well. If Ranno wants to go high and go for falling aerials
                        to get you I would treat him like a Forsburn or Zetterburn: wait for his move to come out and
                        miss and then rush in and punish his whiff. In terms of positioning against him, I usually like
                        to stay mid-close range to him, as Ranno tends to have some trouble dealing with characters that
                        are right in his face where he cant get any setups that he wants, along with aerial needles not
                        being able to hit reliably if you are close enough to him, and once you parry a dart, you can
                        usually rush him down fairly well. Though these are the distances I like to use, Etalus can play
                        from a variety of ranges, so feel free to experiment and find out what works for you depending
                        on the Ranno’s playstyle and how you feel. It’s good to always apply a fair amount of pressure
                        on Ranno, and you don’t want him to get any setups or dart charges, since those can make him a
                        hassle to deal with.</p>
                    <p><span>For Tongue</span>, While all of Rannos moves can be a pain to deal with, tongue sits above
                        the rest as the move to learn to deal with. This move is a killer to be hit with, as it usually
                        leads into a combo that will either put you into an edgeguard (which is terrible against Ranno)
                        or just kill you (which is even worse). Ranno has 2 variations of his tongue grab: his grounded
                        version which just sends straight forward, or the aerial version which comes out diagonally.
                        This move is very strong as it can cover tech options and snuff out many grounded approaches.
                        When approaching the grounded version, a short hop will usually send you right over the hitbox
                        of the move. Baiting out tongue with a WD back or jump can also help a bit, as the move has a
                        good amount of endlag and can be punished fairly easily if it misses. If the tongue is
                        unavoidable (perhaps you are falling without DJ or airdodge and you see him starting a tongue
                        up) you can either fair armor through it, or use icicles to disrupt him when tongue first hits
                        you. Most of the same things apply to aerial tongue: icicles can be very good at disrupting the
                        move, and fair armor goes through the move forever since it doesn't have any scaling knockback,
                        meaning you can safely approach tongue with a good fair to punish him with a heavy hit
                        afterwards. Also this ties into trying to stay slightly above or behind ranno, since that will
                        cause aerial tongue to miss most of the time. However, if you can get good at it, the best thing
                        to do is to slow down your game. Ranno tongue plays similar to Kragg down special in the sense
                        that if you just rely on dash attack and wavedashing around, this move will punish you heavily.
                        Instead try to run around and get a feel for what he throws out. Dash dancing and Cactuar
                        dashing are very key to stopping his tongue: while they don’t let you move quite as fast as the
                        good old dash attack into WD back, they do give you more time to react to what the opponent is
                        throwing out. As a final note, if you can get good at the timings, parrying tongue is the
                        ultimate way to deal with it.</p>
                    <p><span>For Moves</span>, getting through Ranno’s moves can be another hard part of this matchup.
                        Ranno has large moves that can cover a lot of space and come out at decent speeds. However, if
                        we look at the hitboxes, we can see that Ranno’s moves have basically 0 disjoint. This means
                        that we can muscle our way in using Etalus’ generous disjoint, and the holy grail of all moves:
                        Fair. With Fair you can armor through:
                        (Fair until 77%, Bair from 42-79%, Nair from 72-149%, Dair until 212%, Uair until 66%, Uspecial
                        until 181%, Divekick until 51%, Tongue until 999%, Dash attack to 61%). Uair is also a very good
                        kill move against Ranno as his horizontal recovery can be lacking, so a good stage knockoff can
                        be a death sentence for him. If you find your approaches getting snuffed out by darts often, you
                        can use ftilt to approach on the ground or platform movement to approach with a plat drop aerial
                        such as nair. Armor works very well against Ranno; Ranno doesn't do very well at dealing with it
                        and it also helps you recover without any fear of darts or fair spikes.</p>
                    <p><span>For Recovery</span>, Ranno has ton of tools to make sure you never get to see the ground of
                        the stage ever again. For starters make sure to save your double jump and air dodge until you
                        need to use them, as without them you are at the mercy of Ranno to get back onto the stage. If
                        Ranno is going off the stage to chase, feel free to give him some icicles to stop him in his
                        tracks. Fair armor can also be a lifesaver, as it lets you get past his fair until a decent %
                        (see above for exact %). For decent disjoint on recovery, falling nair or bair can do the trick
                        since ranno has very little disjoint. The classic reverse uspecial fair, bair, or dair can also
                        help a ton against ranno, as bair comes out quick and reaches far, fair can block his moves and
                        then reverse the edgeguard, and dair has good disjoint behind and below you. Normally if Ranno
                        hits you with a move and tries to set up for a spike, it is best to just drop low or drift
                        farther away so he cannot find the follow up, and since Etalus’ recovery already has very good
                        vertical reach, it usually won’t affect you much.</p>
                    <p><span>For Edgeguarding</span>, with his fast moves and oppressive coverage, Ranno can be a bit of
                        a hassle to edgeguard, but Etalus has some great tools to help with this. Ideally, the best
                        solution would be to chase Ranno offstage with your combo and finish him off with a fair, uair,
                        or even a dair if you wanted to. If ranno is trying to recover from farther away, icicle into
                        uair or other setups can be a great way to punish his recovery (be careful not to just spam
                        icicle though or else you’re just giving him another uspecial to recover with). Using Fair, you
                        can punish his uspecial by tanking either the rise or divekick, then just punishing him with a
                        fair back off the stage. Alternatively, if you don't want to deal with challenging his recovery
                        disjoints, you can punish his landings with a dash attack or any other move. Just be mindful
                        that this probably won't work as well since, if there are platforms, Ranno can edge cancel his
                        divekick.</p>
                    <p><span>Conclusion/Special Thanks</span>, Although this is a hard MU for Etalus, we have all the
                        tools at our fingertips to slide through Ranno’s moves and slip into that victory screen. Ranno
                        has large moves to block out our approaches, but using good movement, and move spacing, we can
                        easily overcome this challenge. Ranno has great edgeguarding tools, but by playing smart and
                        saving our resources, we can manage to fight our way back to stage. It’s a tough fight, but with
                        a bit of practice, victory will be in the bag for you.</p>
                    <p><span>Quick Notes TLDR</span>, Try to outangle Ranno since his moves leave weak spots above him.
                        Platform movement can be helpful, while Disjoints are very good. Fair armor is a huge power
                        boost.
                        As always, save your resources when recovering. Focus less on using dash attack wave dash to
                        move in neutral.</p>

                    <h3>Matchup Guide:</h3>
                    <h3>Etalus VS Kragg</h3>
                    </br>
                    <p><span>Written By NCB 01/18/2018</span></p>
                    <p><span>The Difficulty</span> in this matchup stems almost entirely on the volatile nature of each
                        characters
                        punish game. Mindful recoveries, and rapid trading, this is an even 50/50 matchup.</p>
                    <p><span>In General</span>, although it may feel one-sided, both characters can engage on the other.
                        They can combo and
                        edgeguard very well. The stock is decided by who jumps on who first. Kragg has good specials and
                        many aerial or grounded
                        tools to beat out any hasty approaches. However, using good disjoints, superior movement,
                        amazing combo potential, and
                        being mindful of hesitation from the Kragg will lead you to victory easily.</p>
                    <p><span>For Movement</span>, spacing is by the most important element. Without proper spacing, a
                        good Kragg
                        will beat you every single time you approach. Kragg excels in close and long range neutral. You
                        can not
                        mindlessly rush him down. Instead, take advantage of your superior ground movement and speed to
                        space around and
                        exploit Kragg's weakest spot - his mid range. A good space to be against Kragg is far enough
                        away to not get hit by an
                        unreactable jab or dash attack, while still being close enough to punish him for pulling a rock.
                        Although this may seem
                        like a small window, feel free to experiment with your approaches and what distances work for
                        you. The goal is to be out of his range,
                        but enough to pressure him, so that you can react and exploit a poor option that he chooses. If
                        the Kragg is aerial often, a quick Icicle
                        will send him back down. Pressure him with dash attack wavedash back, focusing primarily on the
                        punish game.</p>
                    <p><span>For Moves</span>, we need to figure out what works best in beating down Kragg.
                        The normal dashattack won't do much in this matchup. You lose out to down special, fair, or a
                        counter dash attack. Fair armor
                        is viable at lower percents if he tries to throw a rock or engage. Forward tilt also breaks
                        rocks thrown in the air.</p>
                    <p><span>For Recovery</span>, I cannot stress enough, is saving your airdodge and doublejump until
                        after you up special. This is something I see many Etalus players fail to do and it will hurt
                        you in the long run, especially against someone who edgeguards you so well like Kragg. If a
                        Kragg tries to chase you off stage a lot, icicles can be your best friend since they can
                        interrupt him in midair. If a Kragg uses a high pillar to catch you, I like using icicles
                        slightly before I wall jump off of pillar. This allows me to reposition with a wall jump, and it
                        breaks the pillar right after, cutting down on kraggs movement options. Don't use icicles on a
                        grounded opponent though, this will just lead to them parrying it and you will either just get
                        back into an edgeguard situation or you’ll just die. For the Kraggs that like to wait near edge
                        instead of chasing you off, saving your jump and airdodge will help you out maneuver them with
                        some smart thinking. For those that like to spam nair into follow up or use rock shards, fair is
                        a very useful tool to help deal with them, as the low knockback on the moves mean you can armor
                        through them until fairly high percents. If you just want to beat them out, you can always go
                        for a reverse uspecial into a bair, or if you’re feeling a bit saucy, a reversed fair to armor
                        through and then punch them off the stage. In general, reversing your up special is almost
                        always a good idea, since it opens many more options than it removes. Recovering will take some
                        good move decisions, and some quick thinking with aridodges; with a bit of practice however,
                        you’ll be getting through them in no time</p>
                    <p><span>For Edgeguarding</span>, while chasing Kragg offstage is nice. We want to keep him off
                        stage. Kragg is a very heavy character and can take a while to kill if you simply let him
                        recover every time. Kragg’s pillar has a lot of windup to it, so he’s fairly easy to catch with
                        a fair while hes raising the pillar to him, or if he’s try to recover above you, go for the
                        classic icicles to uair. If you know you won’t be able to secure and edgeguard kill and need to
                        wait him out and edgeguard, try not to let him recover close and under the stage, as he can
                        usually just set up rock recoveries or shorthop uairs if you try and get too close to the edge.
                        When this happens the best thing to do is usually sit back and wait to punish his landing; as
                        bad as it is for you, it’s the only safe thing that can be done reliably about Kragg’s low
                        recovery. If Kragg is at ground level and farther away with pillar don’t be afraid to use
                        icicle, but use it in a way that the final icicles hit the side of the pillar and not on top, as
                        a parry can usually lead to a free recovery and a hard punish afterwards.</p>
                    <p><span>Conclusion/Special Thanks</span>, This theme of this MU is big: big punishes, big combos,
                        and big edgeguards. Kragg has the advantage in close and long range fights, but using our
                        superior movement we can easily get around that. Kragg can body us hard in the air when we
                        recover, but saving our movement options and playing smart will help us get back on stage more
                        reliably. Though it may seem like a bad MU on surface level, we have all the tools at our
                        disposal to turn the tide on Kragg and come through with the Win. Hopefully this guide will give
                        you that little boost of knowledge that you need to win for the sake of Etalus mains everywhere.
                        I’d like to thank Menace13 and Lord Bagel for helping to collaborate on this guide; with the
                        amazing knowledge they also put into here, victory is guaranteed.</p>
