                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size
                    of a
                    marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile,
                    so
                    delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

                    <h3>Matchup Guide:</h3>
                    <h3>Etalus VS Absa</h3>
                    </br>
                    <p><span>Written By NCB</span></p>
                    <p><span>The Difficulty</span> in this matchup stems from the long range harassment, limited
                        recoveries, and insane fair-chains that Absa brings.
                        Luckily, mentors from the Rivals of Aether Academy worked together to write this guide.</p>
                    <p><span>In General</span>, despite the overwhelming long range poke, deadly aerials, and movement,
                        Etalus is not at a complete loss. Through
                        the use of rapid movement, disjoint moves and smart icicle usage - we can apply aerial pressure
                        to keep Absa right where we
                        want her.</p>
                    <p><span>For Movement</span>, Etalus is forced to take the role of aggressor in this matchup.
                        Through good platform movement
                        we can mitigate some of the cloud and ftilt options from Absa. Although, it's good to learn how
                        to reliably parry cloud, ftilt,
                        thunder line, and the timed explosion. Learning the timing windows and switching up movement
                        through plats allows us to close the gap.
                        It's important to note, avoid using DA or Wd for grounded movement, instead electing for running
                        as this lets use crouch to CC her Ftilt2
                        immediately. Be mindful when dropping down from plats as, even though Fair and Nair are
                        effective, we want to avoid Absa's nasty Utilt.</p>
                    <p><span>For Stage Selection</span>, while they don't have a giant impact on the matchup performance
                        - because Icicles are critical
                        to lock down Absa in the air, choosing small maps makes the challenge greater. Prioritize
                        larger, more open stages to deal with Absa.
                        Such as Merchant Port or The Fire Capital. Rock Wall is a trade off: while the open stage means
                        good icicle use, the close blast zones
                        means that Absa can carry you off stage with fair strings. We're not partial to ToH or Glacial
                        Fortress because of the close platforms.
                        Endless Abyss is also very risky: there are no platforms for Absa to hide from the icicles,
                        there is nothing to assist you in dodging Ftilts,
                        or clouds. Tempest Peak is alright, however sometimes the side platforms can hurt your
                        edgeguarding if Absa recovers low.</p>
                    <p><span>For Recovery</span>, saving your airdodge and double jump, try to recover using other
                        means. Be mindful that
                        when recovering high with Uspecial, Absa can chase you with Uair and kill you off top. Where as,
                        if you try to recover low
                        or near the stage, she can plant a cloud and contest the edge. Look to immediately wall tech
                        this. When recovering high,
                        throwing out Icicles can support you coming down. Or alternatively, the use of Fair armor.</p>
                    <p><span>For Edgeguarding</span>, the Absa's that like to recover with Uspecial movement, Etalus can
                        beat her out with proper spacing
                        on his disjoints. Alternatively, you can crouch cancel her Uspecial and then react with an
                        immediate punish.
                        For Absa's that recover low, using icicle with uspecial spike can handle her. Alternatively, if
                        she uses quick clouds to recover
                        then look for the opportunity to parry or fair armor through. As always, look for icicle to uair
                        confirms, or dtilt at edge.</p>
                    <p><span>Special Thanks</span>, I'd like to thank Bullets for help with the Edgeguarding section,
                        and to
                        all of the RoA Academy staff for the great help. With their shared knowledge, victory is in the
                        bag!</p>
                    <p><span>Quick Notes TLDR</span>, platform movement to deal with Ftilts and grounded clouds.
                        Wavedash less, run-to-crouch more.
                        Fair armor and Disjoint are very helpful when approaching. Save resources when recovering.
                        Icicles are essential to
                        apply aerial pressure. Stage selection favors Fire Capital and Merchant Port. Finally, be wary
                        when approaching Absa from above.</p>
